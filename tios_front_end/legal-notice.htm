You must not establish a link to our site in any website that is not owned by you. We reserve the right to withdraw linking permission without notice.</p>
								
								<p><strong>No Waiver.</strong> Our failure to insist upon or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.</p>
